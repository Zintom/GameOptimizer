# Text inside a '<>' tag is treated as a flag to indicate the type of processes that proceed it, for example:
#
# - <Whitelisted> - Processes after this tag should not be affected by the 'priority limiter'.
# - <Games> - Processes after this tag should be considered a game and should benefit from affinity optimization, processes
# under the <Games> tag are also treated as <Whitelisted> and will not be affected by the 'priority limiter' either.
