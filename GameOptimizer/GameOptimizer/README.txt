--- What does this application aim to do? ---

	Zintoms Game Optimizer boosts gaming performance by limiting the 'priority' of other processes and optionally limiting how many CPU cores they can use (processor 'Affinity').

--- Important! Usage: ---
	
	When on the Main Menu, you have two methods of boosting, using the pre-built modes under 'Quick Options'(highly suggested), or by manually entering a command via the 'Command Input' option.

	To view more info on commands see 'help' in the Main Menu.
	
	All processes you do NOT want affected by the optimizer are kept in a file called "process_whitelist.txt", which is automatically generated when you first run the app. By default, it contains some of the processes that I suggest you do not remove (i.e Steam), this ensures that your Steam Overlay etc will not lag out when you run the optimizer.
	
	To add new apps/games to the program; first find the app/game executable name (either through Task Manager or by going to the installation path of the app/game and finding the .exe file); Copy the application name into the "process_whitelist.txt" file on a new line *without* the '.exe' extension. If you wish to group different applications in the file together, you can use the comment symbol '##' to label sections, the optimizer ignores whatever is written in front of this symbol so you can label sections like '## Games', '## Apps', etc etc.

	If you use communication apps like Discord, Teamspeak or Mumble, I suggest you add these to the whitelist file.
